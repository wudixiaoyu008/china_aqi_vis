Air pollution is a leading cause of death across the globe, and contributes to stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and other respiratory illness. This is an explorative project to learn and visualize the air quality of different cities in China by using dataset during the year of 2004 to 2014. The goal of this project is to find out patterns of air quality change overtime, and to see if thereâ€™s any correlation between pollution level and other factors related to city population and man-made factors (GDP, Population, Secondary Industry, etc).
